# DiscJ - Discord Music Bot

## üìú About The Project

DiscJ is a simple Discord bot created with the goal of allowing friends to listen to YouTube videos (not just music)
simultaneously in a voice channel.

This project was developed as a personal learning opportunity, providing a chance to explore the TypeScript language,
the Node.js ecosystem, how to consume different APIs (Discord and YouTube), and how to build an interactive bot from
scratch.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Play YouTube Videos**: Simply use the `!dj play` command with a search term.
* **Playback Queue**: Add multiple videos to a queue to be played sequentially.
* **Playback Control**: Commands to skip, stop playback, and clear the queue.
* **View the Queue**: Check which videos are waiting to be played.
* **Built with TypeScript**: Modern, typed, and more maintainable code.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) - The main library for interacting with the Discord API.
* [@discordjs/voice](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@discordjs/voice) - For managing voice connections and audio
  playback.
* [@distube/ytdl-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@distube/ytdl-core) - To fetch information and generate audio
  streams from YouTube videos.
* [Google API Client](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-nodejs-client) - To interact with the YouTube Data API
  v3.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow the steps below to run your own instance of DiscJ.

**Prerequisites:**

* Node.js (version 16.9.0 or higher)
* A Discord account and a server where you have permission to add bots.
* A Google Cloud account.

**1. Create a Discord Bot:**

* Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
* Click "New Application" and give your bot a name.
* Navigate to the "Bot" tab and click "Add Bot".
* Enable the "Privileged Gateway Intents": `SERVER MEMBERS INTENT` and `MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT`.
* Copy your bot's **token**. You will need it soon.

**2. Set up the YouTube Data API:**

* Go to the [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
* Create a new project.
* In the navigation menu, go to "APIs & Services" > "Library".
* Search for "YouTube Data API v3" and enable it for your project.
* Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials".
* Click "Create Credentials" > "API key".
* Copy the generated **API key**.

**3. Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

**4. Install Dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

**5. Configure Environment Variables:**

* Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project.
* Add the following variables:

   ```env
   DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN_HERE
   CLIENT_ID=YOUR_BOT_CLIENT_ID_HERE
   GUILD_ID=YOUR_DISCORD_SERVER_ID_HERE
   YOUTUBE_API_KEY=YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY_HERE
   ```

* You can find the `CLIENT_ID` on the "General Information" tab of your bot in the developer portal.
* To get the `GUILD_ID`, right-click your server icon in Discord and select "Copy Server ID" (you need to have Developer
  Mode enabled in your Discord settings).

**6. Compile the TypeScript Code:**

```bash
npm run build
```

**7. Start the Bot:**

```bash
npm start
```

If everything is correct, you will see a message in the console indicating that the bot is online.

## üöÄ Commands

All commands must be prefixed with `!dj`.
